1.What are the advantages and disadvantages of each of the two scheduling policies? Also, give the advantages and disadvantages of the round robin scheduling policy originally implemented in Xinu.


=============================================Default roundrobin scheduler=================

Advantages:

1.There is no overhead involved in selecting a process for rescheduling . 

Disadvanatges:

1.In the default scheduler low priority process may face starvation if there are any high priority process in the queue.The below two
schedulers overcomes the starvation problem.

================================Exponential distributed  scheduler====================

Advantages :

1.Removes the problem of starvaion of lower process by choosing them based on the random value generated 

Disadvantages:

1. There is overhead involved in selecting the process based on random value.
2. As the scheduling is randomized, it is based on the lambda value.
3. As observed from the result, the lower priority gets more chances in the exponential distribution
when compared to the higher priority ones which should get more chances.
   

===============================Linux based scheduler =======================

Advantages :

1. Removes the problem of starvation for lower priority pocess by giving them a chance to execute in each epoch.
2. Also takes into consoderation the remaining time and allow a process to carry forward the qunatum for the next epoch if it gets suspended in current
epoch.
3. As this is based on goodness value, highest ones are followed by the lower priority ones.



Disadvantages:

1.There is overhead involved in selecting the max goodness value process. 
2.The highest priority ones should wait for one epoch inorder to get a chance to execute again.




Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

In All the above schedulers NULLPROCESS  comes into picture only when there are no other process in the ready queue.
