Kernel level programming, Implemented -> Demand Paging, reader writer locks, priority Inheretence, Linux like scheduler
 -

The objective of this introductory lab is to familiarize you with the process of compiling and running XINU, the tools involved, and the run-time environment and segment layout.
PA1 (Linux like Scheduler) -

The objectives of this lab are to get familiar with the concepts of process management like process priorities, scheduling and context switching. Implemnted - 1) Random Scheduler 2) Linux-like Scheduler (based loosely on the 2.2 Linux kernel)
PA2 (Reader Writer Locks, Priority Inheretence) -

You are going to implement readers/writer locks as described in this handout. Additionally, you will implement a priority inheritance mechanism to prevent the priority inversion problem when using locks. Implemented 1- (1) Lock Deletion (2) Locking Policy (3) Wait on Locks with Priority (4) Releasing Locks (5) Using Variable Arguments 2 - Priority Inheritance
PA3 (Demand Paging) -

Demand paging is a method of mapping a large address space into a relatively small amount of physical memory. It allows a program to use an address space that is larger than the physical memory, and access non-contiguous sections of the physical memory in a contiguous way. Demand paging is accomplished by using a "backing store" (usually disk) to hold pages of memory that are not currently in use.
